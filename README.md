## C++ CLI Calculator (CPPCC)
A fast and efficient command line calculator made using C++ with robust unit testing.

# How to run program:
- Download source files onto your machine.
- Ensure you have GNU compiler (GCC) installed.
- Ensure you have 'make' installed (to be able to use Makefile).
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the 'make' command in your terminal by typing "make".
- The program will compile the exacutable file (which you can run by './calculator').
- Follow the prompts to calculate away!

# Testing
- Testing is done using Catch2's C++ testing library.
- You can run 'make test' which will create a test_operations exacutable.
- Then run the exacutable via "./test_operations" to get the result of the tests.

# Project takeways:
I started this program a year ago when I was learning C++ for my class. I knew that I really wanted to take on the challange of creating a calculator with what was at the time the most confusing programming language I had to learn. Despite the steep learning curve, I found C++ really enjoyable and loved the static typing which helped me think more about my code and be sure something would work (no room for bugs, it either works -- or doesn't). I am very happy to have finished this long set out goal. I love the classic feel with the modern take on things such as #pragma once being much better accepted accross compilers.
